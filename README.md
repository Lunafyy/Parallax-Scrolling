# Parallax Scrolling

## What is Parallax Scrolling?
Parallax Scrolling is a technique used in game development to produce an effect of closer objects moving faster and further away objects moving slower. This effect has also been seen elsewhere such as website development.

## How do you achieve this effect?
This effect is one of those that looks harder than it really is. Lets say we have a canvas of different sized dots moving all in one direction, then we make the smaller dots move at the global speed multiplied by their scale, this will then make the closer/larger dots move faster and the more distant ones move slower. Simple.....right?

## How do you demonstrate this?
I am using this in a very simple black and white environment to produce a cool starfield effect.

## I opened it, but nothing is moving, what's wrong?!
By default, all 'stars' will be static. To control the stars use the UP and DOWN arrow keys!

## I have no idea what that means, can I see an explanation somewhere else?
Of course, you can view the [Wikipedia for Parallax Scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling) or click the link here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling.
